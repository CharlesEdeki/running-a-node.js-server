# Web Server with NodeJs

## What is a web server?

Now let us use an example to get this straight. Let's say you go to a restaurant and you want to make an order. You probably know what you want but the waiter still brings the menu for you to be more specific. You choose the specific meal you want and other things inclusive, then the waiter goes to the one who serves to give him/her exactly what you've "specifically" ordered. Minutes later your order is served.


Now you in that example is your system/browser (client), anytime you try to go to a website (www.thewebsite.com), your browser goes to a Domain Name Server (the waiter who knows the appropriate address of the particular website you want to go, usually the addresses are called Internet Protocol addresses e.g 172.168.23.1), but in this case the DNS sends the actual address back to your browser/syetm so that your browser/system can communicate directly with the server (which is the Web Server).

A Web Server is what serves your browser webpages of the websites you want to visit.
